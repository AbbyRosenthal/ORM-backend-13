# DESCRIPTION
This project uses sequelize to create a database for categories, products and tags.  Through tables were created to connect the database tables while keeping data organized and avoiding redundancy. The walkthrough video demonstrates how infomration can be retreived, added and deleted using the Insomnia app. Routes were created to connect information to the user requesting it.  Next steps would be to create a front end user interface where information could be displayed and changed as needed.
